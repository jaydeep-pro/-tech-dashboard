## Formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. To ensure consistent formatting across the project:

1. Install the Prettier VS Code extension
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. The project will automatically format on save in VS Code

### Formatting Commands

- `npm run format` - Format all files
- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly

### Formatting Rules

- Single quotes for strings
- 2 spaces for indentation
- 100 characters line length
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays
- No tabs, only spaces
- Consistent line endings (LF)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
